# Veta-Project Read Me

## Description 
A simple program that can be used to run Black-Sholes Calculations to price options  
Python is the tool I used to pull the data from Yahoo which was easy with the pandas_datareader package  
  
I plan on using Flask for the UI interface because,
* It is a light weight and scalable application
* It allows me to still use and practice Python
* I don't know anything else and I have to start somewhere

## Purpose
This project was undertaken with the self-imposed deadline of one week.  
I wanted to challenge myself and show that I am capable of learning, iterating and shipping a project under pressure.
